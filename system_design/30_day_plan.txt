🎤 INTERVIEW PREPARATION TIPS

How to approach system design interview:

Step 1: Clarify requirements (5 min)

Ask about users (how many?)
Ask about scale (requests per second?)
Ask about features (what's in scope?)
Functional vs non-functional requirements
Step 2: High-level design (10 min)

Draw boxes and arrows
Client → Load Balancer → API → Database
Explain each component briefly
Get interviewer buy-in
Step 3: Data model (10 min)

What data to store?
SQL or NoSQL?
How to shard?
Show schemas/documents
Step 4: Deep dives (15 min)

Interviewer picks 2-3 components
Explain in detail
Trade-offs, alternatives
Bottlenecks and solutions
Step 5: Wrap up (5 min)

Review design
Discuss monitoring
Discuss failure scenarios
